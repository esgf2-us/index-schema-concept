# Sasha Ames - file record changes 

The file `examples.json` contains two competing proposed changes to the ESGF index file record to replace the *"record-per-replica"* arrangement used at present.  The first idea has *Access first* where the access methods (eg *https*, *Globus*) are shown, and underneath has the locations that support the particular type of access and the specific urls or required information.

The second sub-record presents the information as *Location First*, in which case the sites are presented, and then the specific access methods for each site.  

Recent discussion favored the *Access First* scheme as being potentially more application-programmer friendly.
